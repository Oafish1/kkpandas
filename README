This project allows you to read KlustaKwik or Klusters formatted data files into Python.


KKFileSchema: an object that handles interaction with filesystem to check for which KK files exist and does some simple error checking. Pure Python!

kkpandas: a module that actually does the reading of the files and formats them into pandas DataFrame. The main function to use for this is:
    kkpandas.from_KK(path_to_klusters_files)

I chose to use the pandas module for this because the DataFrame object is a rich way to deal with structured data like this, and also because the plaintext reading functions in pandas appear to be much faster than numpy/matplotlib equivalents for this application. Still you will find that the speed of reading plaintext is the rate-limiting step.
