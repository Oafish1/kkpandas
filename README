This project allows you to read KlustaKwik or Klusters formatted data files into Python.


KKFileSchema: an object that handles interaction with filesystem to check for which KK files exist and does some simple error checking. Pure Python!

kkpandas: a module that actually does the reading of the files and formats them into pandas DataFrame. The main function to use for this is:
    kkpandas.from_KK(path_to_klusters_files)

I chose to use the pandas module for this because the DataFrame object is a rich way to deal with structured data like this, and also because the plaintext reading functions in pandas appear to be much faster than numpy/matplotlib equivalents for this application. Still you will find that the speed of reading plaintext is the rate-limiting step.

There has been some drift in the KK file format specification over time. For instance, Klusters *requires* that the last column in the fetfile be the list of spike times, and that the number of features include this time, even though this is not a true feature of the spike. (Thanks to John Schulman for pointing this out.) Also, the xml file that Klusters uses disallows the use of a group numbered `0` and essentially insists that you start with 1.
